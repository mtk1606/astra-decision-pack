## Pilot Program Allowlist Requirement

### Purpose
GrowthSignal is designed for legitimate competitive intelligence gathering. To prevent misuse and ensure compliance with website terms of service, all pilot participants must provide an approved allowlist of competitor domains.

### Requirements
- **Pre-approval Required**: All competitor domains must be pre-approved before monitoring begins
- **Business Justification**: Clear business rationale must be provided for each domain
- **Contact Verification**: Pilot participants must verify they have legitimate business interest in monitored companies
- **Domain Validation**: Only publicly accessible business websites are permitted

### Allowlist Format
```json
{
  "company_name": "Example Corp",
  "domain": "example.com",
  "business_justification": "Direct competitor in SaaS analytics space",
  "monitoring_frequency": "daily",
  "approved_date": "2024-01-15",
  "approved_by": "pilot_coordinator"
}
```

### Prohibited Domains
- Personal websites or blogs
- Government or educational institutions
- Non-profit organizations (without business justification)
- Competitors outside your direct market segment
- Domains with explicit "no scraping" policies

## Robots.txt Respect Policy

### Compliance Requirement
GrowthSignal **strictly respects** robots.txt directives on all monitored websites.

### Implementation
- **Pre-flight Check**: Verify robots.txt before any data collection
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect crawl-delay directives
- **Path Restrictions**: Honor Disallow directives
- **User-Agent**: Use identifiable user-agent string

### Robots.txt Violations
- **Immediate Stop**: Cease monitoring if robots.txt changes to disallow
- **Notification**: Alert pilot coordinator of any robots.txt violations
- **Investigation**: Review and document any accidental violations
- **Remediation**: Implement immediate fixes for compliance issues

### Monitoring Logs
All robots.txt interactions are logged for compliance auditing:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "domain": "example.com",
  "robots_txt_status": "respected",
  "crawl_delay": 10,
  "disallowed_paths": ["/admin", "/private"],
  "user_agent": "GrowthSignal-Pilot/1.0"
}
```

    # Redact phone numbers
    text = re.sub(r'\b\d{3}[-.]?\d{3}[-.]?\d{4}\b', '[PHONE]', text)
    
    # Redact names (basic pattern)
    text = re.sub(r'\b[A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+\b', '[NAME]', text)
    
    return text
```

#### Reporting Requirements
