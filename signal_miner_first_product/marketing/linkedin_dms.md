# LinkedIn DM Templates for Founder Outreach

## Template 1: Competitor Intelligence Focus
**Subject:** Quick question about competitor monitoring

Hi [First Name],

I noticed you're focused on growth at [Company]. Quick question: how do you currently track competitor changes (pricing, features, messaging)?

Most founders I talk to are either:
- Manually checking competitor sites (time-consuming)
- Using generic tools (not growth-focused)
- Missing opportunities entirely

We built GrowthSignal to automatically turn competitor signals into growth experiments in 48 hours. We're helping teams ship experiments 10x faster.

Would love to show you how it works if you're interested. No pressure - just thought it might be relevant to what you're building.

Best,
[Your Name]

## Template 2: Experiment Velocity Focus
**Subject:** Growth experiment velocity

Hi [First Name],

I read about [Company]'s growth focus and wanted to ask: how many experiments does your team typically run per month?

Most SaaS companies I talk to run 1-2 experiments/month, but the top performers run 10-20. The difference is usually having systems to continuously monitor competitors and turn signals into experiments.

We built GrowthSignal to automate this entire workflow - from competitor monitoring to experiment execution. Teams using it are shipping experiments 10x faster.

Would be curious to hear about your current process and see if there's a fit. Happy to share some examples of how it works.

Best,
[Your Name]

## Template 3: Revenue Impact Focus
**Subject:** Revenue growth opportunity

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: when was the last time you noticed a competitor change their pricing or features?

If you're not actively monitoring, you might be missing revenue opportunities. We recently helped a client identify a competitor's new pricing tier, ran a similar test, and saw a $50K increase in monthly revenue within 30 days.

We built GrowthSignal to automatically detect these signals and turn them into evidence-backed experiments. The entire process takes 48 hours instead of weeks.

Would love to show you what signals we're finding for your market. No obligation - just thought it might be valuable.

Best,
[Your Name]

## Template 4: Research vs Execution Focus
**Subject:** Growth team efficiency

Hi [First Name],

I read that most growth teams spend 80% of their time on research and only 20% on execution. That means 4x more time analyzing competitors than actually running experiments.

We built GrowthSignal to flip this ratio by automating:
- Competitor website monitoring
- Signal analysis and prioritization  
- Hypothesis generation
- Asset creation (landing pages, emails, copy)

This frees teams to focus on what they do best: executing and optimizing experiments.

Would love to show you how it works if you're interested. We're currently onboarding a few growth teams for our pilot program.

Best,
[Your Name]

## Template 5: Success Rate Focus
**Subject:** Growth experiment success rates

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: what's your team's current experiment success rate?

Most growth teams I talk to have a 20-30% success rate, but the teams using evidence-backed experiments (based on competitor data) are hitting 60%+.

We built GrowthSignal to create evidence-backed Decision Packs that include:
- Clear hypothesis based on competitor signals
- Expected lift predictions with confidence levels
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Ready-to-ship assets

Would love to show you how it works and see if we could help improve your success rate. Happy to share some case studies.

Best,
[Your Name]

## Follow-up Template (if no response after 3-5 days)
**Subject:** Quick follow-up

Hi [First Name],

Just wanted to follow up on my previous message about GrowthSignal. 

I know you're busy, so I'll keep it brief: we're helping growth teams turn competitor signals into experiments in 48 hours instead of weeks.

If you're interested, I can send over a quick demo video or case study. If not, no worries at all.

Best,
[Your Name]
